**AI-powered storytelling platform for creating research-backed short-form videos.**

ShortForge Studio helps creators turn a simple idea into a fully edited, narrated short-form video — without a traditional editing suite. Write a brief, gather supporting research, generate a grounded script, review and refine the narration, build timed scenes, edit on a timeline, preview in the browser, and export production-ready video.

The platform is built around one principle: **the story drives everything else.** Narration is written and spoken before scenes are planned, so timing follows the voice.

Exported videos carry a **FootieBitz** watermark (creator/channel branding). The product name is **ShortForge Studio**.

## Features

### Story Creation

- **AI script generation** — Documentary-style narration from topic, tone, duration, and story mode
- **Storytelling modes** — Story, tactical review, match preview/recap, player analysis, top 5, historical explainer, and opinion/debate
- **Research-backed content** — Smart Research and Research Preview gather verified football context before writing
- **Script review** — Edit title and narration on a dedicated review screen before audio production
- **Voiceover** — Natural TTS with voice and speed controls
- **Scene generation** — Audio-first storyboards timed to measured narration

### Editing Studio

- **Timeline editor** — Arrange scenes, captions, and transitions on a vertical 9:16 canvas
- **Scene management** — Add, reorder, and refine individual scenes
- **Image positioning** — Pan, zoom, and Ken Burns motion per scene
- **Background music** — Optional bed with volume control in preview and export
- **Voiceover controls** — Regenerate narration and adjust playback speed
- **Subtitle synchronization** — Captions aligned to narration timing
- **Live preview** — Interactive device-frame playback synced to audio

### Export

- **Browser rendering** — Client-side compositing; no server-side video farm
- **WebM export** — In-browser capture via MediaRecorder
- **MP4 export** — High-quality muxing via FFmpeg.wasm
- **Audio synchronization** — Voiceover and background music mixed in the final file
- **Draft persistence** — Save and reload work across sessions (browser localStorage)

## Story Creation Pipeline

The creator-facing workflow from brief to download:

```
Create
  ↓
Review
  ↓
Voiceover
  ↓
Scene Generation
  ↓
Editor
  ↓
Preview
  ↓
Export
```

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|----------------|
| **Create** | Enter a topic, story mode, tone, duration, and optional notes. Smart Research and Research Preview run the Intelligence Runtime when enabled. |
| **Review** | Edit title and narration, confirm the script, and prepare for audio production. |
| **Voiceover** | OpenAI TTS generates narration; measured duration drives all downstream timing. |
| **Scene Generation** | Scenes, captions, and transitions are planned against the voiceover (audio-first). |
| **Editor** | Refine scenes, images, motion, music, and captions on the timeline. |
| **Preview** | Live 9:16 playback validates timing, subtitles, and audio mix. |
| **Export** | Canvas rendering and FFmpeg.wasm produce downloadable WebM or MP4. |

For the full system path including research and rendering, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md#high-level-flow).

## Intelligence Runtime

ShortForge Studio is not a single prompt to an LLM. Research, reasoning, and story planning run in structured layers before script generation.

```
User Brief
  ↓
Intent Engine
  ↓
Entity Resolver
  ↓
Competition Resolver
  ↓
Query Orchestrator
  ↓
Provider Registry
  ↓
  ├── API Football
  ├── Static Knowledge
  └── Future Providers
  ↓
Canonical Research Bundle
  ↓
Knowledge Graph
  ↓
Graph Context
  ↓
Prompt Intelligence
  ↓
OpenAI
```

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **User Brief** | Topic, story mode, tone, duration, and optional creator notes. |
| **Intent Engine** | Classifies story type (preview, recap, ranking, player focus, opinion, etc.). |
| **Entity Resolver** | Identifies players, teams, and competitions referenced in the brief. |
| **Competition Resolver** | Maps competitions and seasons to provider-ready identifiers. |
| **Query Orchestrator** | Plans research calls, order, and fallbacks. |
| **Provider Registry** | Routes calls to registered backends with diagnostics. |
| **API Football** | Live fixtures, statistics, rankings, and player data. |
| **Static Knowledge** | Curated fallback when live providers return sparse results. |
| **Canonical Research Bundle** | Normalized merge of provider results with provenance. |
| **Knowledge Graph** | Facts, entities, and relationships with confidence metadata. |
| **Graph Context** | Mode-aware research context — ranked facts, entities, grounding rules, warnings. |
| **Prompt Intelligence** | Narrative plan, fact selection, and production prompt text for the LLM. |
| **OpenAI** | Generates narration from structured context — not raw provider JSON. |

Prompt Intelligence is the **primary** production prompt path. Graph Context text is used as a **fallback** when Prompt Intelligence cannot produce a valid prompt.

## Why ShortForge Studio

This is not a thin wrapper around a chat completion. ShortForge Studio runs a **structured Intelligence Runtime** — from intent classification and entity resolution through Knowledge Graph assembly, Graph Context, and Prompt Intelligence — before a single word of narration is generated.

The platform performs **research**, **reasoning**, **story planning**, **script generation**, **voiceover**, **scene generation**, **editing**, and **rendering** as distinct stages. Grounding rules and forbidden claims prevent invented stats from reaching the script.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/footiebitz.git
cd footiebitz
npm install
```

Create `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=...   # optional — enables Smart Research
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with environment variables configured. Export runs entirely in the browser.
